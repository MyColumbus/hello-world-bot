And it is this which has given the village its name. One year on Tweltfh Night however, there was an old woman, who wasn't able to make the trip to the next village due to infirmity, and she hid under the table in the living room, when the trolls came.

Faroe Islands,Gasadalur,"Gásadalur is a village located on the west side of Vágar, Faroe Islands, and enjoys a panoramic view over to the island of Mykines.
Gásadalur is located on the edge of Mykinesfjørður, surrounded by the highest mountains on Vágar. Árnafjall towers to a height of 722 metres to the north, and Eysturtindur to the east is 715 metres high. Here too, the view south to Tindhólmur and Gáshólmur is quite magnificent. Eysturtindur translates to Enlgish as ""the Peak in the East"".
The boat landing site is very poor, because it is located somewhat higher than the seashore. So if the residents wanted to fish, they were obliged to keep their boats near Bøur. In 1940, during the British occupation of the Faroe Islands, a stairway was built from the beach up to the village.
In order to reach any of the other villages by land, residents had to take the strenuous route over mountains more than 400 metres high. This isolation explains why the village population had decreased. In 2002 there were only sixteen people living in Gásadalur, and several of the houses stand empty today.

The boat landing site is very poor, because it is located somewhat higher than the seashore. So if the residents wanted to fish, they were obliged to keep their boats near Bøur. In 1940, during the British occupation of the Faroe Islands, a stairway was built from the beach up to the village.
In order to reach any of the other villages by land, residents had to take the strenuous route over mountains more than 400 metres high. This isolation explains why the village population had decreased. In 2002 there were only sixteen people living in Gásadalur, and several of the houses stand empty today.

Sunda kommuna is formed by the former municipalities of Hósvíkar kommuna, Hvalvíkar kommuna, Saksunar kommuna, Haldarsvíkar kommuna, Sunda kommuna and Gjáar kommuna.
It now contains the following villages:
Hósvík
Norðskáli
Hvalvík
Streymnes
Haldórsvík
Oyri
Oyrarbakki
Tjørnuvík
Gjógv

Saksun
Nesvík
Originally Sunda kommuna was a loose cooperation between the small municipalities, but since 2005 these municipalities agreed to amalgamate.
Altogether Sunda kommuna accounts for 1,655 inhabitants, and the population is steadily increasing. The increase is mainly due to the highway that runs right through the municipality connecting the north-eastern Faroes with the western and southern parts of the Faroes. This highway - currently one of the main-arteries of the Faroes - also features a bridge across the sound that divides Eysturoy and Streymoy, thus creating a region centred on the bridge.

And it is this which has given the village its name. One year on Tweltfh Night however, there was an old woman, who wasn't able to make the trip to the next village due to infirmity, and she hid under the table in the living room, when the trolls came. They danced and partied and made such a noise that the old woman, in fear called out the name of Christ. When the trolls heard the holy name, they stopped partying and cursed the old woman, and left the village, and have never bothered it again.Read more Wikipedia",2,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no

The beach area had its own small promenade and hotel, a suspended walkway, former oyster beds and sealion pool, a large building formerly housing an amusement arcade, paddling pool, and access to the nearby glen of the same name. These days the place is something of a ghost town, disturbed only by the occasional dog walker, but it once had its own funicular railway linking the sea level resort with the Douglas Head Marine Drive Railway atop the cliffs above, the remnants of which can still be traced today.Read more Wikipedia",15,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no

Isle of Man,Derbyhaven,"Derbyhaven is a hamlet near Castletown in the southern parish of Malew, Isle of Man. It is located on the isthmus connecting Langness Peninsula to the rest of the island, on the bay of the same name, and also on Castletown Bay on the other side of the isthmus.
In the 17th century it was a significant port. The then Lord of Mann, James, 7th Earl of Derby, had the fort on nearby St Michael's Isle rebuilt in 1645 to protect Derbyhaven from the parliamentarians in the English Civil War. Later, in the 18th century, the fort served as a lighthouse.
Derbyhaven has a plaque commemorating the Battle of Ronaldsway, in which a Manx revolt led by Guðrøðr Magnússon was utterly crushed by Scottish forces in 1275.Read more Wikipedia",12,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no

Isle of Man,Cregneash,"Cregneash or Cregneish is a small village and tourist destination in the extreme south-west of the Isle of Man, about one mile from Port Erin.
Annual Manx festivals are held in Cregneash and it is home to a flock of the rare four-horned Loaghtan sheep. Much of the village forms a ""Living Museum"" dedicated to the preservation of the traditional Manx ways of life. Officially opened in 1938, the Cregneash Folk Village shows the typical way of life of a small Manx village in the 19th century. Many original Manx cottages have been preserved and exhibit Victorian farming and fishing equipment. Historically most of the cottages were thatched, and this is reflected on many of the cottages. There are also a number of private homes in the village, but their external appearance is controlled to maintain an older look.
A central museum holds a wealth of historical information, whilst many of the cottages in the village allow visitors to see rural activities performed by museum workers in traditional dress. Harry Kelly's cottage in the centre of the village typifies a Manx villager's home, where weaving or knitting often took place in the living area.Read more Wikipedia",1,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
